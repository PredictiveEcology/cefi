## Selecting initial set of challenges

MS Teams  
July 17, 2023 15:30-16:30 (UTC-05:00) Eastern Time (US & Canada).  
Meeting ID: 259 942 951 464  
Passcode: qs6D8h 



### Meeting objectives
There were a number of suggestions for possible challenges put forward at the first meeting, and we didn’t have time to get into the details. The goal for our 2nd meeting will be to narrow in on an initial set of challenges. Initial challenges should be problems that have at least one lead who has capacity to clearly define the challenge and work to make it a reality over the coming months. If you have an idea that for whatever reason can’t go ahead in the coming months that doesn’t mean it won’t happen. The near-term goal is to start building a shared infrastructure, community and momentum with a few examples. Additional challenges can be added. 

[A good first step toward clearly defining a challenge is to fill out this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ibVcZBnNVutlQonD3T7sdhI51brLXq4O1ZGD29crXrM/edit#gid=0)
We added some details for the fire, leaf area index and bird possibilities as a guide. 

Please feel free to skip this meeting if you aren’t interested in expanding the list of initial challenges beyond the proposed fire, leaf area index and Northern Ontario bird challenges. 
If you can’t attend but would like to lead an initial challenge let us know.
For those who cannot attend, the meeting notes will be in this shared document:  [Canadian Spatial Forecasting Challenge(s) Possibilities And Next Steps - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vPOtCOaIcEFiytEw8T9fPXMXRcSVMn-cJYufAyyX-bQ/edit#heading=h.lc3yxglaeuv7)
