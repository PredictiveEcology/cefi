We have a couple of specific ideas (outlined below), and perhaps you have others.\nThis meeting will be an initial brainstorming session for those who can attend.

The goal for our 2nd meeting will be to narrow in on an initial set of challenges. Initial challenges should be problems that have at least one lead who has capacity to clearly define the challenge and work to make it a reality over the coming months. If you have an idea that for whatever reason can’t go ahead in the coming months that doesn’t mean it won’t happen. The near-term goal is to start building a shared infrastructure, community and momentum with a few examples. Additional challenges can be added.\nA good first step toward clearly defining a challenge is to fill out this spreadsheet We added some details for the fire, leaf area index and bird possibilities as a guide.\nPlease feel free to skip this meeting if you aren’t interested in expanding the list of initial challenges beyond the proposed fire, leaf area index and Northern Ontario bird challenges. If you can’t attend but would like to lead an initial challenge let us know. For those who cannot attend, the meeting notes will be in this shared document: Canadian Spatial Forecasting Challenge(s) Possibilities And Next Steps - Google Docs\nFeel free to contribute to the doc whether or not you attend meetings."
